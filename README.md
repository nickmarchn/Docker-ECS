# Docker-ECS
This is a Docker/Ccs project I built using the materials I got from a aws course from https://learn.cantrill.io/.

Here are the steps involved in the project
- Installed and configured docker engine on an ec2 instance
- User docker file to create docker image using local assets
- Tested docker image by running a container using that image
- Uploaded that image to dockerhub
- Created Fargate Cluster
- Created task definition with container definition inside
- Deployed container image as a container
